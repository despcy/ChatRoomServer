README: Simple Sockets Programming Example with Timeout Support
-------

A simple clock server program displays the current time in the
terminal, updating the display every 250 milliseconds.
A simple interactive clock client program can be used to request
the time from the server (or shut it down).
Here, the server has to handle multiple clients at the same time
while constantly updating the clock display.

ClockClient.c: interactive client
ClockServer.c: clock server
Makefile: simple build-script

Communication via TCP/IP sockets is documented very well
in the GNU C Library which can be found online at:
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/index.html#Top
Here, Section 16 deals with the topic of Sockets:
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Sockets.html#Sockets
More specifically, Section 16.9 discusses in detail
how client/server connections work:
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Connections.html#Connections
There, a simple byte stream example (with reusable code!)
is provided for a client
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Byte-Stream-Example.html#Byte-Stream-Example
and a corresponding server:
